            <h3 class="header">Gymnasium №1567</h3>
            <img src="http://karpovni.github.io/portfolio/images/gymnasium.png" alt="Building of Gymnasium №1567" class="img-in-text" />
            <p class="text">My gymnasium currently is 11th in the official rating of all schools in Moscow. I used to study there for 7 years: 3 years in general education class and 4 years in a class with mathematical bias. I have gained much from these years: a lot of knowledge and many friends, some of which are still my best friends. Gymnasium №1567 is something that allowed to get a broad and solid foundation for my future education in university.
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="header">Teachers in Gymnasium №1567 </h3>
            <img src="http://karpovni.github.io/portfolio/images/teachers.png" alt="Teacher: Leonid Isaakovich" class="img-in-text" />
            <p class="text">There are many excellent teachers in my gymnasium. Almost all of them had strong influence on me but I would like to mention just three of them.<br>
            
                <span>Zvavich Leonid Isaakovich</span> is amazingly good in teaching Algebra. He is a creator of many Algebra textbooks. Leonid knows how to introduce his subject properly, so students would understand it. I think that he played a significant role in the choice of my major.<br>
                <span>Khanykova Anastasia Markovna</span> was a Geometry teacher in my class with mathematical bias, she taught me almost everything that I know right now about Geometry. According to the results of Olympiads I was the best among my classmates in geometrical problems. Currently Anastasia teaches Geometry in USA.<br>
                <span>Raskina Julia Anatolievna</span> used to be my English teacher for four years. I have difficult relationships with Julia and I tried to prove that I know English well all the time. Probably that was she who stimulated me to learn English and allowed me to study in an American university without any troubles.           
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="header">First year in MSU</h3>
            <img src="http://karpovni.github.io/portfolio/images/msu.png" alt="MSU Logo" class="img-in-text" />
            <p class="text">In my last year in high school I decided to relate my future major and profession to mathematics closely. The Economics seemed to me an interesting subject to learn in addition to the fact that it is connected to Mathematics pretty close. So, after summer holidays that followed my graduation I flew to America, to MSU that was chosen by me as a university in which I wanted to study. The first year in America was challenging and interesting for me: different people, different subjects and, of course, different language. However all of that didn’t stop me from making some new friends and finishing this first year in MSU with 4.0 for every subject.
