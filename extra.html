			<h3 class="header">Archery</h3>
            <img src="http://karpovni.github.io/portfolio/images/archery.png" alt="Me shooting a bow" class="img-in-text" />
            <p class="text">Among all hobbies that I have archery definitely is the major one. I started shooting bows in my childhood, when I was about 11 years old, and loved it from the very first shot. There is a difference between me and people who are interested in sports archery, where all that matters is accuracy. I love crafting bows by myself and then shooting from them. My aim is not to shoot as accurate as I can but to create an outstanding bow and to have fun shooting it. My hobby was growing up with me and I was learning on my own, trying to solve different problems and developing my crafting skills, and right now I am able to create a two-meter-long bow that can hardly be drawn by an untrained adult. In my opinion, this hobby improved my thinking and problem-solving skills which were applied by me later on in Mathematics.

            <h3 class="header">Chess</h3>
            <img src="http://karpovni.github.io/portfolio/images/chess.png" alt="Chess figures" class="img-in-text" />
			<p class="text">From the 2nd grade in my primary school I started going to a chess club. It wasnâ€™t easy for me back then but I was learning pretty quickly and in some time I was able to play against the club members and win. After three years since my joining I was sent to a chess tournament that continued for two days I lost just once and became 3rd among about 70 participants. Chess is a perfect tool for perfecting analytical way of thinking. I am glad that I have been doing it during my primary school as it shaped my mind nicely.

            <h3 class="header">Fencing</h3>
            <img src="http://karpovni.github.io/portfolio/images/fencing.png" alt="Rapier" class="img-in-text" />
			<p class="text">I decided to try Fencing for the first time in MSU on the showcase of various clubs on Munn Field. I noticed two people fighting with rapiers, found out where they usually practice and arrived at my first training. The master showed me some basic hits, explained to me the basic principles of Fencing and put me in a pair with a member of the club. Although I felt tired after the first fight, I really enjoyed it and decided to keep practicing. I think that Fencing had good impact on my reaction and health. For me, as a student, it is important to have a dynamic activity, apart from going to gym, to stay healthy.
