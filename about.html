            <p class="text">Although I used to study IT (Information Technology) in my high school and performed extremely well on the final exam for the whole course, I have never created an actual working website. So this portfolio and WRA 210, which allowed me to create it, definitely were a whole new piece of experience. </p>
            <p class="text">All the work that I have done may be divided by three parts: designing, coding and writing information for the pages. The last one, writing, was the longest but not the hardest one for me because I’m already accustomed to creation of long papers but I was careful in writing and double-checked what was created.</p>
            <p class="text">I had almost no experience with HTML and no experience with CSS at all before taking WRA 210. All the principles were explained nicely and I was able to begin creating the actual code for this portfolio right after the last lesson. I didn’t have much trouble with coding and in three days almost everything that is related to it was done by me.</p>
            <p class="text">I have always been a mathematician and have never been keen on designing anything. So, I think that the creation of the design for my portfolio was the hardest task among these three. Various design choices were not obvious and easy for me, so I had to spend much time on that. However, I think that the result is worth it.</p>
            <p class="text">Overall, I liked working on creation and the knowledge of that I created the whole portfolio from the very beginning by myself is pleasant to me. My future plans of how to improve this website include the enlargement of my resume and probably rework of categories and addition new items to categories.</p>
